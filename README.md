This matrix was developed during the project to create templates for use by motor freight carriers in procuring telematics solutions ([github nmfta-repo/nmfta-rfp_templates](https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-rfp_templates)) and is now hosted here in its own project.

# Contributors

This requirements matrix and the [Request For Proposal Contract Template Language project](https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-rfp_templates) where it was originally developed was made possible through the generous contributions of
thought leadership and technical expertise of many collaborators across the heavy vehicle cybersecurity community,
working to push the industry forward and make it more resilient. Though some of our contributors wish to remain
anonymous, we are deeply grateful to everyone who has given their time and energy to make this a reality.

# How to Make Contributions

NMFTA would like these requirements to be as useful as possible. We are open to refining them based on your feedback and/or changes which you would like to see made. However, the NMFTA does not want other custom versions of the requirements to be proliferated. This is the reason for the [Creative Commons `BY-NC-ND` 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) license of all the materials here.

The NMFTA will take your request for changes in whatever form is most convenient to you; an email or phone call is sufficient. Github issues and pull requests are welcomed also.
